Hello world!

I am finally trying my hands in natural language. 
Why should Gen AI have all the fun!

I do feel am quite late to this journey of content creation. This industry have enough saturation now, 
to an extent that one not only needs to compete with other human written contents but also AI written contents :).

I have seen people maintaining a particular nieche about what they write, but I will keep this blog a collection of all the types of blog I will be writing.
During this journey I will make mistakes and would rely on you folks on internet to help me correct it and help me go in the right direction. 

## Conditions
I use a lot of emoji while writing, so bear me :) 

## Motivation 
```ts
// TODO: :) 
```
